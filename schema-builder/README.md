# Gaffer Schema Builder

This tool is intended to help with the process of creating a schema for a Gaffer instance.
Currently the tool is made up of a front-end (Javascript) and a back-end (Java).
At this stage of development both are required to be running on the same host, the UI is expecting to find the back-end on "localhost:8080".

## How to run
