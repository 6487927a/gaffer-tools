Python shell
============

This python shell connects to a Gaffer REST API and requires python 3.x

To start using the python shell you will need an instance of the REST API running.
You can start the Gaffer example rest server (see Gaffer repository example-rest/README.md) using the command on the Gaffer project:

```
mvn clean install -Pquick -Pstandalone
```

Once this is running you can run the python example using the command:

```
python3 python-shell/src/main/python/example.py
```

Alternatively if you have you own REST API running that is authenticated with
PKI certificates then you can follow the pki example. Before using the example you
will need to export your PKI certificate into a .pem file:

```
python3 python-shell/src/main/python/examplePki.py
```
